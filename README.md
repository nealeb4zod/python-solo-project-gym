# python-solo-project-gym
First major project for Codeclan - a solo python web app to manage a gym.

# The Brief

>### Gym
>
>A local gym has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register members for classes.
>
>#### MVP
>
>- The app should allow the gym to create and edit Members
>- The app should allow the gym to create and edit Classes
>- The app should allow the gym to book members on specific classes
>- The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
>- The app should show all members that are booked in for a particular class
>
>#### Inspired By
>
>[Glofox](https://www.glofox.com/club-solution/), [Pike13](https://www.pike13.com/pike13-scheduling-software-demo)
>
>#### Possible Extensions
>
>- Classes could have a maximum capacity, and users can only be added while there is space remaining.
>- The gym could be able to give its members Premium or Standard membership. Standard members can only be signed up for classes during off-peak hours.
>- The Gym could mark members and classes as active/deactivated. Deactivated members/classes will not appear when creating bookings.
